### **Single-Page CV Project**

**Overview**

A Big Thank You to roadmap.sh! This project is inspired by the "Single-Page HTML CV" project found on roadmap.sh, a fantastic resource for developers looking to build their skillsets.  Following the roadmap's guidance, I've set out to create a visually appealing and informative single-page CV built with HTML & CSS. The focus lies on ensuring a clean and semantic HTML structure, optimizing the CV for search engines (SEO), and enabling seamless social media sharing.

**Key Features**

-   **Semantic HTML:** Utilizes appropriate HTML tags to ensure a clear and meaningful structure.
-   **SEO Meta Tags:** Incorporates essential meta tags to improve search engine visibility.
-   **Open Graph (OG) Tags:** Enables better social media sharing with OG tags.
-   **Favicon:** Adds a custom favicon for a professional touch.
-   **Modular Structure:** The CV is designed for easy styling in future projects.

**Structure**

The CV is organized into the following sections:

-   **Header:** Contains the basic information, such as name, title, and contact details.
-   **Education:** Lists educational qualifications and institutions.
-   **Skills:** Highlights technical and soft skills.

-   **Projects:** Showcases personal or academic projects.
-   **Footer:** Provides additional information or links.
